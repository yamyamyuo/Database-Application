The main page of the website is movie.html.
I have met all the project requirement.

Additional features:
1. In Add Actor or Director page, I accomplished the Director information adding page.
2. In all the pages, the field of first name, last name, role, dob, title, year, company are set as required field. If user did not input this field, the website could not submit this information to the database.
3. I have also implement the review site. User can write their reviews for each of the movie while they are browsing the movie information.
4. In the search site, I use AND for each of the input keywords.
